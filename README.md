# Command Line Picture Filter Program in C

## Project Description
This is my implementation of the Harvard CS50 Problem Set 4 project. The program takes in an image file (Bitmap format/.bmp) and gives it a filter of either grayscale, sepia, blur or reflection. These options can be chosen by using input flags on the program. Directions are shown below.

Try compiling filter for yourself by going to your terminal and running

```
$ make filter
```

Then, you can run the program by running:
```
$ ./filter -g in.bmp out.bmp
```

> The example above will work for the grayscale taking a picture file named in.bmp and producing another picture file called out.bmp.

In similar fashion you can replace `-g` with `-r` for reflection, `-s` for sepia and `-b` for blur effects.
